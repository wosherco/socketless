# @socketless/react

React library for [socketless.ws](https://socketless.ws).

## Installation

We publish packages to npm. You can install them with your favorite package manager:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash npm install @socketless/react```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    ```bash pnpm add @socketless/react```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun">
    ```bash bun add @socketless/react```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash yarn add @socketless/react```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

You can use `useSocketlessWebsocket()` hook directly, but we recommend generating components based on your types.

For that, create a new file, and generate the components:

```tsx title="src/lib/socketless.ts"
import { generateSocketlessReact } from "@socketless/react";

export const { SocketlessProvider, useSocketless, useSocketlessWebsocket } = generateSocketlessReact<SocketlessMessage, SocketlessResponse>();
```

## Components

There are three components you can use:

- `SocketlessProvider`: Provider for the websocket client. You can use this in a parent layout, so connection doesn't get interrupted when navigating.
- `useSocketless`: Hook to get the client and last message. Grabs the client from the provider.
- `useSocketlessWebsocket`: Hook to get the client and last message. It's totally independent from the provider.


## NextJS

We're considering creating a NextJS library for easier functionality. Meanwhile, you can use the provider creating a client component first.

```tsx
"use client";

import { SocketlessProvider } from "@/lib/socketless";

function NextJSSocketlessProvider({ url, children }: { url: string; children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <SocketlessProvider url="ws://localhost:8080">
      {children}
    </SocketlessProvider>
  );
}
```
