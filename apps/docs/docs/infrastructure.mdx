# Infrastructure

So you're curious about how Socketless works under the hood? Great! Let's dive into it. I'm going to separate the explanation into two parts: locally, and globally.

## Local Infrastructure

The backbone of Socketless is a Postgres database, and a redis server (we use [dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydb.io/)). These two services are the ones that store all the data and manage the connections.

Our service scales horizontally, so we can add more servers to handle more connections, thanks to redis.

## Global Infrastructure

We globally replicate our postgres database for redundancy and lower latency, contrary to redis, which is in each location working independently.

Appart from the service that handles the connections, we also have a service that we like to call "Truth-keeper" that's unique in each location. It keeps a single source of truth of redis information for each location, so we can have a better control of the connections, and super low latency.
