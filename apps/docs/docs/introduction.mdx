# Introduction

Websockets are a pain to deal with, from coding the initial server, to handling connections on the client, and scaling the server to handle more connections. That's why we created Socketless, where our mission is to make websockets simple.

- **Simple**: Socketless is designed to be easy to use and understand.

- **Fast**: Socketless is built using [Bun](https://bun.sh) [(benchmarks)](https://bun.sh/docs/api/websockets) and Dragonfly [(benchmarks)](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks).

- **Scalable**: Socketless is built to scale horizontally with ease. [Check out the infrastructure](https://docs.socketless.ws/docs/infrastructure)

- **Global**: Socketless is built to be used globally. [Check out our cloud locations](https://docs.socketless.ws/docs/locations)

## Getting started

## Using our cloud

If you want to start using Socketless right now is as simple as signing up at [app.socketless.ws](https://app.socketless.ws). We will take care of the infrastructure, latency, scaling up, etc. If you want a hassle-free experience, this is the way to go.

## Self-hosted

If you want to self-host Socketless, you can follow the [Self-Hosted](/docs/self-hosting) guide. This is totally free.
