## Connections

Connection tokens are created and currently last for 24 hours (subject to change). Once a connection token expires, the client will be disconnected. You have the option to renew a token _(more info soon)_.

## Incoming Messages

Messages sent by clients through the websocket are not billed if they are ignored (no webhook, etc.).

## Outgoing Messages

Messages published to the channel or to an individual client are billed. Responses to a webhook message aren't counted towards this meter. If the channel is empty (no one is listening), it won't be counted towards this meter.
