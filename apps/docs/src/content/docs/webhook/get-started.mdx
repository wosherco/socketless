## Setting up webhooks

Let's see how to setup webhooks with Socketles:

<Steps>

1. [Create a project](https://socketless.ws/dashboard) or [go to your existing project](https://socketless.ws/dashboard), and head to the `Settings` page. There you will see the `Webhook` section.

2. Now, you'll need to set an endpoint to your server. If you're developing locally, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a public url.

3. You'd want to verify that the requests coming though your endpoint are really from Socketless. For that, Socketless send an `Authentication` header with the Webhook Secret. Store it in a safe place an verify it for each request.

4. You're done! For more information, check out the API Reference about webhooks.
